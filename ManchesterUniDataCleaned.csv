The Norman migrants established powerful states throughout the Mediterranean, especially the Crusading Principality of Antioch and the Kingdom of Sicily. The latter developed into a unique multicultural state inhabited by Muslims, Greeks and Latins, and governed by Norman Kings who dressed in Byzantine robes, resided in stunning Arab-Islamic palaces, promoted alleged crypto-Muslim eunuchs to positions of power, and commissioned magnificent multicultural monuments.

This course unit looks at the ways in which government, colonisation, science, slavery, nature, the law, gender and political identity were interrogated in work by a range of writers. Through a focus on the idea of citizenship the course considers the relationship between radicalism, activism, and political action. This concern with agency leads us to consider some key 21st century ideas in the light of their discussion during the earlier period: imprisonment and the law; citizenship and action; the environment.",https://www.manchester.ac.uk/,https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2021/09248/ba-english-literature-with-creative-writing/course-details/ENGL34131,ENGL34131,Semester 1,Level 3,20,No

Instead, examining the development of Western Europe in comparative perspective alongside three comparative case studies – the Islamic world, Byzantium and China – this module will seek to revisit this dynamic period in which empires rose and fell, world religions took root and spread, and new models of trade and connectivity emerged. By c. 1300, when this module concludes, the world was beginning to look much more ‘modern’, and this was precisely because of – not in spite of – the changes experienced in this transformational period.  ",https://www.manchester.ac.uk/,https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2021/00184/ba-classics/course-details/HIST10262,HIST10262,Semester 2,Level 1,20,No

We will situate select works of art, too, within sundry political and historical contexts. The goal is to see how the works are shaped by different social factors and, conversely, how narratives of modern Chinese history and culture are, themselves, mediated and reimagined in fiction. A variety of primary texts will be paired with relevant secondary scholarship.

We will think about our own preconceptions of what opera is by studying the wide variety of forms of early music drama, the array of contemporary terms used to describe such works, and the musical genres that contributed to opera’s development in the seventeenth century, including the intermedio, masque and ballet. We will explore the background to the earliest examples of opera through the humanist activities of the Florentine Camerata as well as through the context of sixteenth-century Italian stage music. The philosophical background to and poetic roots of early opera will also be used to help you learn about the way in which inner meanings (allegory and symbolism) were incorporated into early opera, and how these could be used to serve political ends in some contexts. Detailed investigation of the repertory will take place through six case studies, highlighting the earliest operas (seen through Peri’s Euridice and Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo); the commercialisation of Italian opera (seen through L’Incoronazione di Poppea); the development of a French national style of opera (seen through one of Lully’s tragédies en musique, Armide); and the English resistance to the all-sung form (seen through comparison of Henry Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas with his dramatick opera King Arthur).",https://www.manchester.ac.uk/,https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2021/02397/musb-music/course-details/MUSC30931,MUSC30931,Semester 1,Level 3,20,Yes

In this course unit we depart from linearity and normality, the very strict limitation in Linear Models. We study the extension of linearity to non-linearity and normality to a commonly encountered distribution family, called the exponential family of distributions. This extension forms Generalized Linear Models (GLM). The GLM, on the one hand, unifies linear and non-linear models in terms of statistical modelling. On the other hand, it can be used to analyze discrete data, including binary, binomial, counted and categorical data that arise very often in biomedical and industrial applications.

This structure is not defined in terms of a distance function but in terms of certain subsets known as open subsets which are required to satisfy certain basic properties.

Although there are some similarities with the familiar theory of one real variable, the theory for functions of several variables is far richer. For example, for functions of several variables, the critical points might be maxima, minima or saddle points (which are minima in one direction and maxima in another direction). A key idea is to generalize the definition of the derivative at apoint to the the derivative of a map  <i>f</i>:<b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>&rarr;<b>R</b><sup><i>m</i></sup> at a point <i>a</i> of <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>. This is the Fr&eacute;chet derivative, which is a linear map <i>df</i>(<i>a</i>):<b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup>&rarr;<b>R</b><sup><i>m</i></sup> (often represented by a matrix whose entries are partial derivatives) which gives the best approximation to the function at the point <i>a</i>.

European integration has made rapid progress in the last two decades, moving from the creation of a common market to a currency union, enlargement to twenty eight member states and further plans to strengthen economic and political union. On the other hand, recent setbacks (such as the collapse of the ‘European constitution’ and the current Eurozone crisis) have rekindled debates concerning the legitimacy, speed and direction of the European project. While member states retain sovereignty in many areas, they share it in others. Meanwhile, certain types of competence have been ceded almost entirely to the EU. The module explores the historical context behind integration, the development of EU institutions, the decision-making process and popular attitudes to closer union, as well as selected policy areas.

What is the nature of our relationship to our own bodies (if relationship is even the right word)? And, what is the relationship of the body to wider society? These questions have a philosophical and theoretical aspect and early lectures explore this aspect. Fleshing out these theoretical bones, however, requires reflection upon empirical studies of such issues and social practices as obesity and bodybuilding, cosmetic surgery and tattoos. A large part of the course is devoted to just this.

Usually, where a theory of learning is not made explicit, it is taken for granted that children have somehow been properly socialised and that there is no need, therefore, to consider such processes further because learning is thought to pertain to children and childhood and not to adults who are the more typical subjects of anthropological research.

Firstly, it analyses the ways in which moving and still images (film, painting, photography) have been used to articulate critical portrayals of Spanish society and effect social and political change. Secondly, it studies the impact of emerging technologies such as the illustrated printed press, photography and film on the development of new techniques of visual representation. Thirdly, it analyses how visual technologies and visual techniques of representation have shaped the expansion of mass culture, the development of the public sphere and processes of public opinion-making. Rather than separating these three approaches, this course combines them in order to help students enhance their analytical and critical skills. The course begins in the late nineteenth century, when mass entertainment was born in Spain, and proceeds chronologically through the late twentieth century. The course is focused on broad social developments rather than on specific historical events and will cover the following periods: the Restoration regime (1874-1931); the Second Republic (1931-1936); the Civil War and Franco dictatorship (1936-1975); the Transition to democracy and post-Transition period (1975-1992).

Surrealism put sexual desire at the centre of its revolutionary practice. It can legitimately claim to have been the very avant-garde of the modern discourse of sexuality in France, pioneering the reception of psychoanalysis, while valorising sexual perversion and pathology. The heterosexist structure of orthodox surrealism is evident in its cult of ‘woman’, and its leader’s (selective) repudiation of male homosexuality. We will interrogate and critique that structure, considering its (and our own) historicity, while examining how surrealist visual and textual production put at risk or ‘queered’ normative masculinity. We will see how women artists and writers appropriated and critically redeployed surrealist tactics. In order to pursue these topics we will acquaint  ourselves more generally with the history and theory of gender and sexuality in modern Europe, making use of psychoanalytic, feminist, and queer-theoretical perspectives.",https://www.manchester.ac.uk/,https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2021/00251/ba-history-of-art/course-details/AHCP23711,AHCP23711,Semester 1,Level 2,20,Yes

This lecture-based course examines how artists, and visual art creators make sense of the complex phenomenon of globalization in South Asia in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It explores how art has become a tool for political expediency, reflection and intense scrutiny. We look at how artists contribute to, disrupt, or subvert discourses and practices, and place their contributions in political, social and economic contexts. Specifically, we analyze art produced from  the 1980s, a period of economic and societal liberalization, when former colonial countries opened to the world after experiences of Third World utopianism. This was a time of self-criticism and re-appraisal, when artists felt that nationalism had fundamentally constrained their practice. Moreover, they confronted new threats posed by the surge of corporate monopolies, the growth of the militant right and challenges to secularism posed by fundamentalism.

The primary focus is on Britain, France and Germany. Key questions include: How did British, French and German societies try to come to terms with mass death and trauma? How did the dead impinge upon the lives of the living in the post-1918 and post-1945 period? What does ‘normalisation’ mean? What normative discourses did post-war societies develop about the role of the father and sexuality? Can we interpret the emergence and development of humanitarian and human rights as a way of ‘turning away from war’?

Institutions like woman-woman marriage and various gender-transgressive identities suggest that many African cultures do not divide people into “men” and “women” in the same way Western cultures have done. At the same time, the wide-ranging political and economic transformations of the last century have had profound implications for gender and sexuality, causing changes in the sexual division of labor and in domestic life.

The course will then ask how modern science, technology and medicine did eventually emerge in East Asia during the nineteenth-century and examine its sociopolitical, cultural and economic backgrounds as well as what the notion of civilizations and modernity meant for East Asia.

This unit will look at the social and political conditions which gave rise to this phenomenon: the patrons who commissioned works from writers and artists; the artists and writers who produced them; and the audiences that consumed them. Ranging across multiple media and multiple modes of production, from the invention of printing to the founding of the disciplines of history and archaeology, attention will be paid to the assertion that the Italian Renaissance witnessed the emergence of the modern world both at the level of the nation state and the individual. In addition to the consideration of such canonical figures as Machiavelli, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci, we will examine the interrelation between high culture and the social life of the everyday to understand the context for the circulation and regulation of cultural production.

How in the 1990s did companies like Starbucks train their workforce to ‘treat their customers like celebrities’? This course examines shifting ideas about work in the modern US, alongside the remaking of the concept leisure, which, in the 1880s, was uncoupled from its long-standing associations with idleness, and placed at the core of the country’s labour movement. The module examines the broad transformations in the US economy, from the emergence of the Ford Motor Company’s factory system and ‘scientific management’, to its replacement with variant forms of service work, particularly amid the ‘retail revolution’, and the rise of Wal-Mart and, more recently, Amazon. All of these transformations reorganized not only what Americans did, but also how they thought about work, adjusting the length of the working day, remaking the relationship between work and leisure, and changing opportunities for rest and recreation. Students will consider the recreational activities that won popularity among Americans across the social spectrum between the end of the nineteenth and the start of the twenty-first century, and consider how political, technological, and architectural changes shaped the provision of facilities—from New York’s Coney Island to California’s Disneyland. The module uses a wide variety of texts, including written accounts, as well as photographs, paintings, and films, and a variety of original sources, including ",https://www.manchester.ac.uk/,https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2021/00255/ba-history/course-details/AMER20112,AMER20112,Semester 2,Level 2,20,No

Spanning the eighteenth century to the present day, the course highlights moments of radical rupture in the development of German culture alongside persistent continuities. It begins with the German Enlightenment as an intellectual precursor of the French Revolution that challenges established hierarchies of authority. It examines progressive and revolutionary thinking, together with authoritarian reaction, in art and politics during the 19th-century struggle for civil rights, and national and individual self-determination. The birth of psychoanalysis is foregrounded in the early 20th century, as are ideas of radical subjectivity, which are explored in Expressionist art, overthrowing confidence in the rational self. Despite the extreme reactionary destructiveness of National Socialism, the cultural repercussions of early 20th-century achievements remain tangible today in second wave feminism and beyond. Similarly, the revival of revolutionary thinking and anti-imperialism characterized the Student Movement of 1968, which will be compared with the post-1989 critique of neo-liberal capitalism. The overthrow of the East German state is also viewed as a revolution. However, the renewed growth of populist politics in the light of the triumph of global capital has created its own form of nationalist reaction.",https://www.manchester.ac.uk/,https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2021/00237/ba-german-studies/course-details/GERM10350,GERM10350,Full year,Level 1,20,Yes
